Some basic info about stuff and things
======================

There will be stuff here eventually. For now, though, it's a pretty rough work in progress. If you have any suggestions of bug fixes, I'd love to hear them! Feel free to poke around at the code here and send over pull requests! Helpful criticism is always welcomed.

### Some details for those who don't feel like poking around:

- This is a Jekyll-based site
- Primarily HTML and CSS (not HAML and SASS...yet)
- This is mostly serving as a project to get used to doing some coding on my own, so progress may be slow
- I'm still a novice at most of these things, so some things might be rough
- Simple GitHub pages hosting now, with hopes of moving elsewhere in the future
- Domain was purchased and is managed via [Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com)
- I still don't understand how to make things responsive

### Now I'm playing around with Codeship:

It's a cool concept for a site and service. I don't have a lot of use for it right now, but I like what they're up to. [Check them out!](https://codeship.com/)

Here's the thing you use to see if your builds are ready to rock and roll:

### Some links I've found _super_ helpful along the way (beyond the regular Jekyll docs):
