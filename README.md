Some basic info about stuff and things
======================

There will be stuff here eventually. For now, though, it's a pretty rough work in progress. If you have any suggestions of bug fixes, I'd love to hear them! Feel free to poke around at the code here and send over pull requests! :D

Some details for those who don't feel like poking around:

- This is a Jekyll based siteâ€“-Jekyll rules
- Primarily HTML and CSS (not HAML and SASS...yet)
- This is mostly serving as a project to get used to doing some coding on my own, so progress may be slow
- I'm still a novice at most of these things, so some things might be rough
- Simple GitHub pages hosting now, with hopes of moving elsewhere in the future
- Domain was purchased and is managed via [Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com)

Some special thanks for all their help on this site, both in advising and in emotional support:

- James Zhang
- Danielle Bushrow
- Jeff Vincent
- Max Schnur
- Mercer Smith-Looper

Now I'm playing around with Codeship:

Some links I've found _super_ helpful along the way (beyond the regular Jekyll docs):
