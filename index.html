  <p class="textcenter">This site here is a little project I'm (sort of) working on to practice my coding chops. As you can tell, they've not come all that far just yet, but that's why it's a work in progress! For those curious, it's a Jekyll based site hosted via GitHub Pages for the time being. I have a bunch of ideas of how to make this site look nice, but for the time being it's going to look like a fourth grader's computer class project. Ciao!</p>
